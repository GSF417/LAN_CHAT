# USAGE

Input the desired IP and ports of the host in the indicated fields, and then hit CONNECT.

The first program initialized must have the Run as Server option checked and will run as both Server and Client.

Additional programs running must connect to the same IP and port and will run as Clients.

Each Client is assigned a name based on the NATO phonetic alphabet.

Please utilize a port that is not currently in use, else the program will not work.
